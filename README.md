## Objective
This assignment aims to develop a web application utilizing vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of JavaScript's core concepts, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), This assignment focuses on developing a dynamic and interactive quiz web application using vanilla JavaScript (ES6+). The objective is to showcase a comprehensive understanding of JavaScript's core concepts, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), generators, asynchronous programming, and the manipulation of the this keyword, within the context of building a quiz app.

The primary goal is to create a feature-rich quiz experience where users can engage with a series of questions presented one at a time. The application should allow users to answer questions, receive immediate feedback on their responses, track their scores, and progress through the quiz seamlessly. Additionally, the quiz app should be designed with a user-friendly interface, enhancing the overall user experience.
